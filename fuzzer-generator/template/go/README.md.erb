# Setting up your new fuzzer

1) Place the gofuzz zip file into this directory - it will be copied into the docker container.

2) Edit `environment`, which sets all environment variables for the Docker
container. You must ensure GO_FUZZ_ZIP is set.

3) To run the fuzzer, call: `/root/fuzzer-files/<%= @fuzzer_name %>/start` from
within the docker container
